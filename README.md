# Server

## About
- This is just a support application of the Captain game.
- It allows the user to host a server on the local network so that the game can connect to it.
- Data is exchanged between the server and game and the data is stored by the server in a separate file.
- Run the server application first before starting the game.
- The game can be played without the server but the player wont be able to save or load his data without being connected to the server.
